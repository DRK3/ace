# Vault Server

The Vault Server is an abstraction over
[Confidential Storage](https://identity.foundation/confidential-storage/) vaults and
[WebKMS](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/webkms/) key stores.

## How it works

See the [OpenAPI spec](./docs/openapi.yaml).

### Creating Vaults

When a user creates a vault in the Vault Server:

* a [Decentralized Identifier](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) is created for the vault
* a WebKMS key store is created with the vault's DID as its controller
* a Confidential Storage vault is created with the vault's DID as its controller

### Storing documents

When a user stores a document in a vault in the Vault Server:

* the user provides a unique identifier for the document and its contents
* the contents are encrypted with a random encryption key
* a new key pair is created in the WebKMS key store
* the encryption key is encrypted by the WebKMS service using the new key pair
* the encrypted artifacts are assembled into an _EncryptedDocument_ and stored in the Confidential Storage
  vault

### Authorizations

When a user authorizes a third party to access a document, the Vault Server creates two authorization tokens:

* One token to use at the Confidential Storage Vault backend to retrieve the encrypted document
* One token to use at the WebKMS keystore backend to unwrap the encryption key for the document
